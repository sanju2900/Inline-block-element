    <h1><b><i>Infation accelerates to
        7.41%, highest since April </i></b></h1>
        <br>
        <p><u>September food infation quickens sharply to 8.41%</u>, the steepest level in 22 months; economists
            warn that the negative surprise could spur more interest rate increases from the RBI</p>
            <br>
                <p><b style="font-size: 100px;">R</b>etail infation accelerated to a fvemonth high of
                7.41% in September, from
                7% in August, as food infation surged sharply to
                8.41% last month — the
                steepest level in 22
                months.
                <i style="color: red;">Septembers retail infation was the highest since
                    April</i>, when price rise
                quickened to an almost
                eight-year high of 7.79%,
                and economists warned
                that the latest negative surprise could force the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to
                opt for further interest rate
                increases beyond the widely expected 0.5 percentage
                point increase in the December monetary policy.
                This is the ninth month
                in a row that infation has
                exceeded the 6% upper tolerance threshold mandated for the RBI and would
                require it to send an explanation to the government
                on its inability to achieve
                the price stability target.
                Rural infation picked
                up further steam, from
                7.15% in August, to touch
                7.56% in September, while
                urban consumers also experienced a resurgence in
                price rise at 7.27%, from
                6.72% a month earlier, data
                released by the National
                Statistical Ofce (NSO) on
                Wednesday show.
                Vegetable prices surge
                Infation in cereals quickened to 11.5%, with rural
                India facing almost 12%
                price gains, up sharply
                from 9.6% in August and almost doubling from July’s
                6.9% pace. Similarly, vegetables’ infation almost virtually doubled over two
                months, from 10.9% in July
                to 18.1% in September, with
                urban consumers facing a
                sharper 20.1% rise. </p>
